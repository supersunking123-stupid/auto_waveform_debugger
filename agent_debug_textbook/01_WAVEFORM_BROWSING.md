# Playbook 01 — Waveform Browsing

**Role:** You are an observer. Your job is to read waveform data — values, transitions, patterns, intervals — without reasoning about RTL structure.

**When to use:** You need to answer questions like "what is happening in the waveform?" rather than "why is it happening?"

## Common sequences

### Sequence A — Explore an unfamiliar waveform

1. `list_signals()` — see the top-level signals (safe starting point; does not dump the full namespace).
2. **Check the time precision before using any time argument** — call `get_signal_info` on any signal and read the reported timescale. Every time value you pass to any tool must be in units of the precision (the second number of the `` `timescale `` directive). See Rule 12 in `rtl_debug_guide.md` for the full conversion table.
   ```python
   get_signal_info(path="top.clk")   # read the timescale field from the result
   ```
3. Drill into the module of interest: `list_signals(pattern="top.u_interesting.*")` — see only that subtree.
4. Narrow further if still too many results: add `types=["input","output"]` to see only interface signals.
5. `get_signal_info(path="top.u_interesting.sig")` — check width/type of a specific signal.
6. `get_signal_overview(path="top.u_interesting.sig", start_time=0, end_time=100000, resolution="auto")` — get the big picture. (Use time values already converted to the correct precision.)
7. Zoom into interesting regions with `get_transitions(...)` or `get_snapshot(...)`.

### Sequence B — Check a bus at a specific time

1. `get_snapshot(signals=["top.addr","top.data","top.wen","top.ren"], time=50000, radix="hex")` — see all related signals at once.
2. If something looks wrong, use `find_edge(path="top.wen", edge_type="rising", start_time=50000, direction="backward")` to find when the write enable last asserted.

### Sequence C — Find when a condition occurs

1. `find_condition(expression="top.state == 3 && top.valid == 1", start_time=0, direction="forward")` — find the first occurrence.
2. `get_snapshot(signals=["top.state","top.valid","top.data"], time=<result>)` — see the full picture at that moment.
3. Repeat `find_condition(start_time=<result+1>)` to find subsequent occurrences.

### Sequence D — Characterize a clock or periodic signal

1. `analyze_pattern(path="top.clk", start_time=0, end_time=100000)` — detect period, duty cycle.
2. If you need exact edges: `get_transitions(path="top.clk", start_time=T1, end_time=T2, max_limit=50)`.

### Sequence E — Count and export activity in a large window

1. `count_transitions(path="top.awvalid", start_time=0, end_time=1000000, edge_type="posedge")` — count assertions without pulling every transition into context.
2. If you need the full dataset, `dump_waveform_data(signals=["top.awvalid"], start_time=0, end_time=1000000, output_path="awvalid_transitions.jsonl")`.

## Tips

- **Always check the waveform time precision with `get_signal_info` before your first time-based query.** Waveform timestamps are in units of the `` `timescale `` precision (the second number). The most common setup is `` `timescale 1ns/1ps ``, which means precision is 1 ps — passing `100` when you mean 100 ns will query time 100 ps instead, 1000× too early. See Rule 12 in `rtl_debug_guide.md`.
- Use `radix="hex"` for buses, `radix="bin"` for control signals where individual bits matter, `radix="dec"` for counters or arithmetic.
- `get_snapshot` with a signal group is efficient: create a group via Session Management, then call `get_snapshot(signals=["MyGroup"], signals_are_groups=True)`.
- `find_condition` accepts compound Boolean expressions — use it instead of chaining multiple `find_edge` calls.
- `max_limit` in `get_transitions` defaults to 50. Increase it only if you truly need more; large results are harder to reason about.
- Prefer `count_transitions` when you need a count, not the full transition list.
  - For **single-bit** signals, `edge_type` accepts `"posedge"`, `"negedge"`, or `"anyedge"`.
  - For **multi-bit** signals (buses), `edge_type` must be `"anyedge"` — it counts value toggles rather than directional edges.
  - Use `boundary_policy="exclusive"` to exclude transitions exactly at `start_time`/`end_time` (default is `"inclusive"`).
- Prefer `dump_waveform_data` when the time window is too large to inspect comfortably through MCP response text.
  - The `mode` parameter selects the output format: `"transitions"` (default) exports every value change; `"sampled"` exports values at regular intervals defined by `sample_period` (in waveform time units). Use `"sampled"` when you need uniform time resolution rather than event-driven data.
- Prefer `get_signal_overview` over `get_transitions` when you need a big-picture view of a long time range.
- **For a compound condition you will query more than once** — handshake, error flag, protocol event — create a virtual signal with `create_signal_expression` instead of repeating the same expression in every `find_condition` call. All browsing tools accept virtual signal names transparently. See `07_VIRTUAL_SIGNALS.md`.

### `list_signals` — avoiding context explosion

On real chip waveforms (FSDB from gate-level or large RTL sims), the full signal namespace can contain tens of thousands of entries. Dumping it unfiltered will fill your context window and leave no room for analysis.

**Rules:**
- **Never call `list_signals(pattern="*")` without a narrowing `pattern` on a large or unknown design.** If you don't yet know the size, start with the default (`pattern=""`) and judge the result count before widening.
- **Use `pattern` to scope to a module subtree** before listing. Example: `list_signals(pattern="top.u_dma.*")` returns only signals under `u_dma`.
- **Use `types` to filter to interface signals** when you only need to know what a module exposes. Example: `types=["input","output"]` shows only ports, skipping all internal nets and registers.
- **Combine both** for maximum precision: `list_signals(pattern="top.u_axi.*", types=["output","net"])`.
- `pattern="regex:<expr>"` accepts a raw regular expression for cases where glob prefix is too coarse. Example: `pattern="regex:.*_valid$"` finds all `*_valid` signals anywhere in the hierarchy.
